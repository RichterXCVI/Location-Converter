Location Converter

                                   "Welcome to my Loc Converter! 

I built this as I'm a noob to Hackmud and Javascript as a bit more familar 
with C#. I decided to build this app not only to help strengthen my coding skills but also, I was tired of 
copy/pasting hundred's of locations to a notepad and then copy/pasta those same locs one by one into my 
cracker during a hack...

* What this does is allow you, the user to paste all your locs at once as long as one per line to Loc box.

* Add your script Prefix [ex:richter.t1cracker] to Prefix box.

* Click convert and watch the magic happen of adding all your locs to the rest of your script!!

* Result: richter.t1cracker {t:#s.uknown_jr_vhslsk.pub_a8rmp9}

Both the loc and results box will auto-scroll if you add enough locations, so don't worry about running 
out of room. I hope you enjoy and find this app useful, it was super simple to make and I love this game 
so much, I can't wait to learn and keep building bigger and better stuff. Until next time folks... 

                                 Happy Hacking and HACK THE PLANET!";
